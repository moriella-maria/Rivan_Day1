♥ 1. correct the settings in VM

♥ 2. power on the VM

♥ 3. un and pw: root/C1sc0123

♥ 4. delete something using script to get an IP
rm -rf /etc/udev/rules.d/70(tab ka na)
reboot

♥ 5. dapat may IP address ka na na pwede mo ibrowse ang gui via browser
for me it's the below,
IP: 208.8.8.129 (it varies)

♥ 6. find the lab photo of routes
so you can see the ports and IP addresses to be assigned

♥ 7. telnet to the IP above and port is depending on which instance you want to access/connect to

HOW TO Configure D1 and D2 as DHCP server for VLAN 10.
D1: .100-.199
D2: .200-.254

!@D1
conf t
	ip dhcp excluded-address 10.2.1.1 10.2.1.99

HOW TO Configure P1 and P2 as DHCP Clients for their VLANs

!@A1
conf t
	interface e0/0
	switchport mode access
	switchport access vlan 10
	end
show vlan brief 
(A1 should now assign VLAN 10 to its DHCP Clients such as P1)

!@A2
conf t
	interface e1/0
	switchport mode access
	switchport access vlan 10
	end
(A1 should now assign VLAN 10 to its DHCP Clients such as P1)

☺ 3. How to configure P1 and P2 as a DHCP Clients
!@P1 
conf t
	interface e0/0
	no shut
	ip add dhcp
	end
	
♣ show ip int brief | ex un
Interface                  IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
Ethernet0/0                10.2.1.200      YES DHCP   up                    up      
→ assigned dynamically by D1 looking at the current IP

!@P2 
conf t
	interface e1/0
	no shut
	ip add dhcp
	end

♣ show ip int brief | ex un
Interface                  IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
